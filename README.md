# hello-world
first and hopefully not last repository

Hi, Humans (Sounds cheesy 'cause I'm a human too '._.)

Readme file is a very important thing for explaining what your project is about, but I'm just gonna write this nonsense which you're reading right now. I don't know why would a person would come here and read it. Guess I should say 'Hi'? Well... "Salutations!".

Are you happy? Because I hope so (HAHAHA)! 

Anyway, have a good time and don't drink milk if you're sick (Bossa studioâ˜º said that, I'm not sure if this is true).
